HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) Y1 direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (Y1) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) Y2 direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (Y2) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>
